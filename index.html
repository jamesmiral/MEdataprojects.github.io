									<p>With this project, I had the opportunity to spearhead a comprehensive analysis of a robust healthcare dataset, geared towards driving informed decisions within the health sector, leveraging the amazing features of Power BI.

										4.      Profit Margin
										5.      Number of Hospital Visits by Patients
